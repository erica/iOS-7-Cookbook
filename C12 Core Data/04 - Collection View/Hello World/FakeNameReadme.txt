Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Isn't this illegal?
A: I really don't see how it could be. If I ask you to make up a random name
   and address, is it illegal if you do?

Q: It would be awesome if you could generate <INSERT ITEM HERE>. Can you add
   it to the Fake Name Generator?
A: Maybe. Send an email to Jacob@FakeNameGenerator.com and I'll see what I can
   do.
   
Q: Can I use these credit card numbers to buy stuff online?
A: No. Its the FAKE name generator, not the real-stolen-credit-card generator.
   All the included credit card numbers are completely fake.

Q: The zip codes and/or credit card numbers and/or social security numbers
   aren't showing up correctly in Excel. How do I fix this?
A: Change the column type to text. This will prevent Excel from formatting the
   numbers into scientific notation and/or stripping leading zeroes.
